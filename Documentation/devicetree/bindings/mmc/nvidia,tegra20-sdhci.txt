* NVIDIA Tegra Secure Digital Host Controller

This controller on Tegra family SoCs provides an interface for MMC, SD,
and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the sdhci-tegra driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,<chip>-sdhci"
- clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - sdhci

Optional properties:
- power-gpios : Specify GPIOs for power control
- nvidia,no-runtime-suspend : No runtime PM support on the host
- nvidia,host-off-card-on : The host is powered off while the card is powered
  on during suspend
- tap-delay : initial tap delay value (for Rx at high freqs)
- trim-delay : trim delay value (for Tx at high freqs)
- ddr-trim-delay : trim delay value for DDR50
- calib-3v3-offsets : Autocal HW offset for 3v3
- calib-1v8-offsets : Autocal HW offset for 1v8
- calib-1v8-offsets-uhs-modes : Mask for UHS mode calibration.  Valid values are:
	Bit 1: SDR12
	Bit 2: SDR25
	Bit 3: SDR50
	Bit 4: DDR50
	Bit 5: SDR104
	Bit 6: HS200
- uhs-mask : disables a UHS mode when corresponding bit set to 1.  Valid values are:
	Bit 1: SDR12
	Bit 2: SDR25
	Bit 3: SDR50
	Bit 4: DDR50
	Bit 5: SDR104
	Bit 6: HS200
- ddr-clk-limit : max clock frequency in DDR mode

Example:

sdhci@c8000200 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-sdhci";
	reg = <0xc8000200 0x200>;
	interrupts = <47>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car 14>;
	resets = <&tegra_car 14>;
	reset-names = "sdhci";
	cd-gpios = <&gpio 69 0>; /* gpio PI5 */
	wp-gpios = <&gpio 57 0>; /* gpio PH1 */
	power-gpios = <&gpio 155 0>; /* gpio PT3 */
	bus-width = <8>;
	nvidia,no-runtime-suspend;
	nvidia,host-off-card-on;
};

Example 2:

sdhci@700b0600 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-sdhci", "nvidia,tegra114-sdhci";
	reg = <0x700b0600 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 31 0x04>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car 15>;
	tap-delay = <0x4>;
	trim-delay = <0x4>;
	ddr-trim-delay = <0x4>;
	ddr-clk-limit = <51000000>;
	calib-3v3-offsets = <0x0202>;
	calib-1v8-offsets = <0x0202>;
	calib-1v8-offsets-uhs-modes = <0x28>; /* DDR50 | HS200 */
	uhs-mask = <0x00>;
};
