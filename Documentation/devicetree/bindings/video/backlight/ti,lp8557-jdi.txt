TI LP8557 Backlight Driver for JDI panels

Required properties:
- reg: 7-bit i2c address
- brightness-mode: Choose how brightness is controlled
	- 0: PWM brightness mode
	- 1: Brightness register mode
	- 2: PWM x unshaped brightness register mode
	- 3: Unshaped PWM x brightness register mode
- step-ramp: Ramp time for 0% to 100% change
	- 0: 0 ms
	- 1: 50 ms
	- 2: 100 ms
	- 3: 200 ms
- step-smoothing: Strength of smoothing filter
	- 0: No smoothing
	- 1: Light smoothing
	- 2: Medium smoothing
	- 3: Heavy smoothing

Optional properties:
- pwm-standby: Enable PWM standby mode after 52ms of PWM pin low
- current: Full-scale current (use R_iset resistor if property is absent)
	- 0: 5 mA
	- 1: 10 mA
	- 2: 13 mA
	- 3: 15 mA
	- 4: 18 mA
	- 5: 20 mA
	- 6: 23 mA
	- 7: 25 mA
- pwm-frequency: PWM output freq (use R_fset resistor if property is absent)
	- 0: 4.9 kHz
	- 1: 9.8 kHz
	- 2: 14.6 kHz
	- 3: 19.5 kHz
	- 4: 24.4 kHz
	- 5: 29.3 kHz
	- 6: 34.2 kHz
	- 7: 39.1 kHz
- boost-frequency: Boost freq (use R_fset resistor if property is absent)
	- 0: 500 kHz
	- 1: 1 MHz
- boost-bcomp: Boost compensation (use R_iset resistor if property is absent)
	- Option 0
	- Option 1
- led-enable:  Array of 6 elements, each represents if the corresponding LED
		string should be enabled (use auto-detect if property is absent)

Example:
		lp8557-backlight@2c {
			compatible = "ti,lp8557-jdi";
			reg = <0x2c>;

			brightness-mode = <0x0>;
			pwm-standby;
			current = <5>;
			pwm-frequency = <1>;
			boost-frequency = <1>;
			boost-bcomp = <1>;
			led-enable = <1 1 1 1 1 1>;
			step-ramp = <0>;
			step-smoothing = <0>;
		};
