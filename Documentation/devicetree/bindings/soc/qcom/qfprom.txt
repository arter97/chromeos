QCOM QFPROM

QFPROM is basically some efuses where things like calibration data, speed bins,
etc are stored. This data is accessed by various drivers like the cpufreq,
thermal, etc.

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain "qcom,qfprom" followed by "syscon"
- reg: Address range for QFPROM
- stride : register address stride.
	1 for byte.
	2 for 2 bytes
	3 for 3 bytes
	4 for a word.

Example:
	qfprom: qfprom@00700000 {
		compatible 	= "qcom,qfprom", "syscon";
		reg		= <0x00700000 0x1000>;
		stride		= <1>;
	};

	tsens@34000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tsens-apq8064";
		reg = <0x34000 0x1000>;
		qcom,qfprom = <&qfprom 0x18 0x10>, <&qfprom 0x28 0x10>;
		qcom,qfprom-names = "calib", "backup_calib";
	};
